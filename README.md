# Capstone

Our mobile development will be implemented purely in native Android using Kotlin and Android Studio. We'll focus on utilizing Android Jetpack components for core functionality. The app will use Material Design components for the UI, implement data persistence with SharedPreferences and handle network calls using Retrofit.

1. Emphasizing the use of exclusively native Android with Kotlin
2. Performing slicing or implementing design into code
3. Main Features:
- Home (displays a list of items from the API)
- Includes a feature to input photos from the camera/gallery
4. Library/framwork/dependency: Android Jetpack Compose, Retrofit, etc.
